# Dragon-Ball-Website
This was a website design I created for my University coursework in a class called "Introduction to Web Development"
I will be developing on this very soon to add some more details to the website.

I will be adding comments into the code itself at a later date. 

Also, the website hasn't been optimised for mobile viewing so if possible view from a Desktop/Laptop for best results
